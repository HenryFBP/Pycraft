This is a project in which I aim to test my abilities and learn new skills, and show what I can do to the community thank you all very much for coming here and I hope you enjoy and are inspired to fire up IDLE yourself. Made with Python 3.7 64 bit and Windows Visual Studio Code for ease of use and id strongly recommend these!

## Setup

Please first before you run the program can you make sure that you have all the files downloaded in the attached folder, then please keep them all inside the Pycraft file and don’t move them about inside the folder, as this makes the program crash and we don’t want that eh!

Also I might just add, this program will be compiled hopefully at the end of the development process in December 2021 or later into a .executable ".exe" file, however for now you will need to have python installed on your system, nothing fancy just the IDLE will do, and id recommend Python 3, I’m developing it on Python 3.7.7 although you should be alright with any Python 3 program.

Then please run the installer; "PycraftInstaller.py" this will make sure that all the modules the program needs to run are installed correctly, before you start complaining yes this is a very badly implemented program but it works for now and I do intend to sort this program out.

## Running the program

Now you have the program properly installed hopefully (you’ll find out if you haven’t promptly!) you need to locate the file "PycraftRunUtil.py" basically all this program does is run the right modules, initiates the main program; "Pycraft.py" and catches any errors that might arise in the program in a nicely rendered error screen, if it crashes on your first run then chances are you haven’t installed the program correctly, if it still doesn’t work then you can drop me an email @ "ThomasJebbo@gmail.com" or comment here on the repository, I do hope however that it works alright for you and you have a pleasant experience. I might also add this program has been developed on a Windows 64-bit computer however should run fine on a 32-bit Windows machine or through MacOS although they remain untested for now. 

I recommend creating a shortcut for the "PycraftRunUtil.py" file too so its easier to locate.

## Dependencies <br />

in case you don't know you can install Pycraft's required modules manually or through the soon to be overhauled installer; named "PycraftInstaller.py" through your Control Panel in Windows (First; press the windows key + r then type "cmd" then run the below syntax) or on Apple systems in Terminal.

```
pip install <module>
pip uninstall <module>
pip update <module>
```
Installing, uninstalling or updating the specified module respectively; pip is usually installed by default when installing Python with most versions.

_Disclaimer; unfortunately lots of these pythom modules (first and third party) can require some external modules that will be installed during the installing process of the above modules, unfortunately this makes it really difficult to give credit to those modules, if you have any reccomendations please cxontact me appropriately._

## Changes

In this new sub-release we have patched a lot of bugs; all the ones as far as I am aware of all have been fixed excluding the installer program that is soon to be discontinued and updated: <br /> :white_medium_square: Fixed audio bugs: both contiuing to play when errors occur and in installer and when loading other menues & fixed the bug when the sound will only play once in the menue after 10 minutes of sound playing <br /> :white_medium_square: Fixed errors in the error exception module with font and unitialized modules. <br /> Again feedback would be much appreciated, and this version was released on; 09/05/2021 (UK date) DD/MM/YYYY. As always we hope you enjoy this new release and feel free to leave feedback. Thank you! And the issues we encountered uploading files to the required locations on Github have since been resolved for your convenience.

### Plans for the future

Performance improvements; maybe faster load times and settings description in sub-version Pycraft-21p1003-21a06 <br />
Massive installer overhaul in sub-version Pycraft-21p0103-21a07<br />
Then... <br />
A final bug fix update before releasing the next Pycraft version!!! <br />

### Our update policy
New releases will be introduced regularly, it is likely that there will be some form of error or bug, therefore unless you intend to use this project for development and feedback purposes (Thank you all!) we recomend you use the latest stable release; below is how to identify the stable releases.

### Version naming
Our individual versions is labeled individually following the format below: eg: 21p1003-21a This is (Date), (First letter of name of game), (Big release ID), (Month), (-), (Year), (Alpha/Beta) Any Unstable releases will also have in addition to the following format, a release code at the end, starting from 01, these indicate how many new revisioons there have been before the last large update.
