Caution, in the next few days this project will recieve a massive overhaul of version renaming, the entire project will be pushed to the new Semantic labeling as seen under tags and latest releases. this means that some versions will be renamed and might be harder to find, however more information on this will be released over the next few days as these changes take effect. 

The reason for this notice is due to a server deployment that will take place over the next few weeks to help aid with updates and development; please dont be alarmed you will be given the option not to use this feature. 

for more information please see my twitter profile @pycraftD (https://twitter.com/PycraftD) and for more regular updates.
