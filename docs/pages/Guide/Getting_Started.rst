Nomanclature and programming techniques
=======

Pycraft maintains a scheme for naming variables and controlling code structure in Pycraft; this section details all the information you will need for understanding the structure for the program, in addition to the nomanclature (a series of rules that determines how objects should be named). This section will also help you understand the comments and documentation attached below, we strongly recommend you read this before getting started!

Some of these rules are NOT yet integrated into Pycraft, but wil be accommodated into versions of Pycraft greater than or equal to v0.9.4 (or v0.9.4-1 pre-release found here: https://github.com/PycraftDeveloper/Pycraft-Insider-Preview).

Variables
+++++++++

* All variables should be named in accordance to its function, or based on a description of the data it stores.
* There is no limit to the length of the name of a variable as at current there is no limit on the length of a line of code.
* Variables must also be preceeded by a data-type
Good examples of variable nomanclature include:
``int_StoresRandomNumber``
or
``vao_StoreMapVertexBuffer``
